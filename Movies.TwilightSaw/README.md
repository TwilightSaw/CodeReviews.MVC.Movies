## Challenges and Learned Lessons
- Doing this project was not very hard after the similar one made with Razor Pages, but classic MVC definitely gives you more space.
- Scaffolding is a really useful feature that you can use for creating controllers from models and db and vice versa.

## Areas to Improve
- Learn more about MVC.
- Improve visual design with CSS, html, Bootstrap.
- Start using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Resources Used
- C# Academy guidelines and roadmap.
- ChatGPT for new information as MVC, CSS, html, Bootstrap.
- Various StackOverflow articles.
- [Microsoft Guideline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio).
